# caps-lock-notfier-on-window
My keyboard doesnt have backlit or indicator so I used to have difficulty  in determining whether caps lock is on or off. Decided to use my python knowledge to solve this problem.  

I have done 3 implementation of caps lock notifier on windows

1) Gui application using tkinter,keybord and pywin32 python libraries 
2) Notfier appliaction using  plyer,keybord and pywin32 python libraries 
3) Notfier appliaction using  win10toast,keybord and pywin32 python libraries 

To install the libraries do following in command prompt 

pip install keyboard
pip install tkinter
pip install plyer
pip install pywin32

Programs can be extended to check num lock and other indicators.
